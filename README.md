# EnMirynet README

## Introduction

Enmirynet is a Web Development project developed by Kwondh0321 and two others. We began our journey by studying both backend and frontend development. With no predetermined theme, numerous services are currently in existence and under development

## Services Roadmap
- AI_EnMirynet : currently using GPT-4, but planning to develop and utilize my own model directly using TensorFlow in the future.
- TrendingTopics_EnMirynet : currently ranking real-time search keywords on Naver and news rankings on Nate. In the future, We plan to support more portal sites.
- Shopping_EnMirynet : Currently, only search results from '11번가' are available due to API integration issues. In the future, We plan to integrate APIs from various shopping sites to provide personalized search results for customers.
- Subway_EnMirynet : As a service still in development, currently, only subway systems in the metropolitan area of South Korea are supported. In the future, I plan to integrate all subway systems by region and provide personalized services using "Geolocation"
